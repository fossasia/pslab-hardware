The goal of Pocket Science Lab is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) and software applications that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and scientists. Our tiny pocket lab provides an array of instruments for doing science and engineering experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement tools including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and even a component to control robots with up to four servos. Our website is at https://pslab.io. The first version of the hardware (v1) was developed by [Jithin B P](https://pslab.io/team/). Later versions were developed by [Padmal](https://github.com/CloudyPadmal).

## Features

### Oscilloscope

One of the main features of PSLab is the 4-channel Oscilloscope which can monitor analog inputs at a maximum of 2 million samples per second. It includes controls such as triggering and gain selection. Uses Python-Scipy for curve fitting.

### Waveform Generator

* SI1: 5 Hz – 5 kHz arbitrary waveform generator. Manual amplitude control up to +/-3 Volts
* SI2: 5 Hz – 5 kHz arbitrary waveform generator. The amplitude of +/-3 Volts. Attenuable via software
* SQx: There are four phases correlated PWM outputs with maximum frequency 32 MHz, 15 nanosecond duty cycle, and phase difference control.

### Measurement Functions

* Frequency counter tested up to 16 MHz.
* Capacitance Measurement. pF to uF range
* PSLab has several 12-bit analog inputs (function as voltmeters) with programmable gains, and maximum ranges varying from +/-5 mV to +/-16 V.

### Voltage and Current Source

* 12-bit Constant Current source. Maximum current 3.3 mA (subject to load resistance).
* PSLab has three 12-bit Programmable voltage sources +/-3.3 V,+/-5 V,0-3 V. (PV1, PV2, PV3) controls

### Other Useful Tools

* 4MHz, 4-channel Logic analyzer with 15 nS resolution.Voltage and Current Sources
* SPI, I2C, UART outputs
* Graphical Interfaces for Oscilloscope, Logic Analyser, streaming data, wireless acquisition and several experiments developed that use a common framework which drastically reduces code required to incorporate control and plotting widgets.
* PSLab also has space for an ESP-12 module for WiFi access with access point/ station mode.

### Advanced Controls
* Advanced Controls with Oscilloscope
* Data Logger
* Logic Analyzer
* Wireless Sensors (Work in progress…)
